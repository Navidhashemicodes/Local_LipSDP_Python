# Python Implementation of Local-LipSDP toolbox

This toolbox  computes the local value of robustness certificates (Lipschitz constant) of deep neural networks. This toolbox is an extension of the [LipSDP](https://github.com/mahyarfazlyab/LipSDP) toolbox which provides the global robustness certificate (Lipschitz constant).

This research work is published [here](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v144/hashemi21a.html) and was presented as a part of L4DC 2021 conference.

## Instalation

There is no need to install the toolbox and you are only required to locate the repository somewhere in your machine. you may run:

**`git clone https://github.com/Navidhashemicodes/Local_LipSDP_Python.git`**


We utilized mosek solver in our experiments, in case you have no access to the license you can easily replace it with another solver when you run the code.
   
## Requirements

MOSEK (optional)



## Example

To replicate the results of the [paper](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v144/hashemi21a/hashemi21a.pdf). The folder **`examples`** is provided.
